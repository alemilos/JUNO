DELETE THIS AFTER PROGRAM IS DONE

TO DOS...

MENU:
- Find a way to open frames with the same W and H of the parent frame (IFF the parent get disposed)
- Strip the username in text-field so that "alessandro".equals("    alessandro  ")
- Level progress bar with JProgressBar to put in the Menu GUI and also in the Profile
- Have an enum with names of each frame. This will allow to work without using getClass()
- Finish the game settings gui: 2 images (labels) needs to go one over the other. The one in the back will represent
the table style, while the other will represent the card back set by the user. This will be dynamic similarly to the
thing I did with the avatar image.

GAME:
- develop the View and implement the controller
- JLayeredPane to display cards over cards
- NOT playing players will have avatar Image NOT enabled, While when they are playing their avatar will be ENABLED
so will show a color. Maybe we will have some effect on this, like slowly increasing his Height and Width
